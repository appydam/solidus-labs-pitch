# Mission Control for HALO: Pitch Deck

**Target:** Solidus Labs (Asaf Meir, CEO + Product/Engineering Leadership)  
**Format:** 7 slides, PDF export ready  
**Tone:** Founder-to-founder, practical, proof-driven  

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

### **HALO Agents Work in Parallel, Not Coordinated**

**Visual:** Diagram showing multiple HALO agents (detection, investigation, reporting) working independently with question marks between them

**Copy:**
> "Solidus HALO processes 1 trillion+ events per day with AI agents. But those agents don't coordinate — they work in silos."

**Pain points:**
- ❌ No visibility into what agents are doing
- ❌ Manual handoffs between detection → investigation → reporting
- ❌ Compliance teams can't track agent decisions for audits
- ❌ Scaling means more chaos, not more efficiency

**Quote from industry:**
> "The biggest challenge in agentic automation isn't detection — it's orchestration." — Every compliance VP we've talked to

---

## Slide 2: The Solution

### **Mission Control = Orchestration Layer for HALO**

**Visual:** Mission Control dashboard screenshot (task view, agent coordination, audit trail)

**Copy:**
> "Mission Control is the coordination layer that makes HALO agents work together."

**What it does:**
- ✅ **Task Orchestration:** Agents coordinate through tracked tasks
- ✅ **Real-Time Visibility:** See what every agent is doing, live
- ✅ **Human-in-the-Loop:** Compliance officers review and approve with full audit trail
- ✅ **End-to-End Tracking:** From alert to resolution, every step logged

**One-liner:**
> "HALO detects. Mission Control orchestrates."

---

## Slide 3: How It Works (Demo)

### **Wash Trading Investigation in 8 Minutes**

**Visual:** Flowchart showing the demo workflow from DEMO_FLOW.md

**Workflow:**
1. **Alert fires** → Task created automatically
2. **Investigation Agent** coordinates with Data Collection, Pattern Analysis, Reporting agents
3. **Human review** → Compliance officer approves with comments
4. **Auto-resolution** → Report filed with regulator, task complete

**Metrics shown:**
- ⏱️ Resolution time: **8 minutes** (vs 2.5 hours manual)
- 🤖 Agents involved: **4** (coordinated, not siloed)
- 👤 Human reviews: **1** (tracked and auditable)
- 📊 Full audit trail: **Every step logged**

**Call-out box:**
> "This is what 'exponential efficiency' looks like in practice."

## Slide 4: Three Ways to Work Together

### **Pick Your Play**

**Visual:** Three columns, each with an icon and brief description

#### **Option 1: Agent Ops (White-Label)**
**What:** Embed Mission Control as HALO's native orchestration layer  
**Who:** Solidus product team integrates directly  
**Value:** Differentiate HALO as the only compliance platform with built-in agent orchestration  
**Revenue model:** License fee or rev-share per client  

---

#### **Option 2: Internal Ops**
**What:** Use Mission Control to coordinate Solidus's own internal agents (not customer-facing)  
**Who:** Solidus engineering team uses it for internal workflows  
**Value:** Scale your own operations before productizing  
**Revenue model:** SaaS subscription  

---

#### **Option 3: Strategic Partnership**
**What:** Co-develop the orchestration layer together, brand it jointly  
**Who:** Solidus + us, shared roadmap  
**Value:** Move faster together than separately  
**Revenue model:** Equity partnership or pilot program  

**Call-out:**
> "We're flexible. Let's find what makes sense for Solidus."

---

## Slide 5: Proof We Use What We Sell

### **Built by AI Agents, For AI Agents**

**Visual:** Squad photo (icons + names) + Mission Control dashboard screenshot showing actual tasks

**Our AI Squad:**
- 🌀 **Kaze** — Chief of Staff (coordinates everything)
- 🔭 **Scout** — Research & Intelligence (found Solidus opportunity)
- 🔨 **Forge** — Engineering (built this pitch deck in 48 hours)
- 👻 **Ghost** — Content & Distribution (will amplify partnership if it happens)

**Traction:**
- ✅ Built Mission Control in 1 week
- ✅ $40k committed ARR (crypto regulatory tracker + other products)
- ✅ 4 AI agents using Mission Control daily
- ✅ All our work tracked through the same system we're pitching

**Credibility:**
> "We built this because WE needed it. Now we're offering it to the best compliance infrastructure company in crypto."

## Slide 6: Traction & Timeline

### **What We've Built (So Far)**

**Visual:** Timeline with key milestones

| **Date** | **Milestone** |
|----------|---------------|
| Week 1 | Mission Control MVP live |
| Week 1 | Crypto regulatory tracker launched ($40k ARR) |
| Week 2 | Agent squad coordinating via Mission Control |
| Week 2 | Pitch to Solidus Labs (you are here) |
| Week 3-4 | Pilot program with Solidus (if interested) |

**Metrics:**
- 🚀 Built in **1 week** (speed matters in AI)
- 💰 **$40k ARR** (proof of commercial viability)
- 🤖 **4 AI agents** (proof we use what we sell)
- 📈 **0 → pitch-ready in 48 hours** (from Scout's research to this deck)

**Quote:**
> "We move fast. If this makes sense, we can start a pilot next week."

---

## Slide 7: The Ask

### **Let's Run a Pilot**

**Visual:** Clean, simple layout with a clear next step

**What we're asking for:**
1. **30-minute call** with Asaf + Product/Engineering lead
2. **Test integration** with HALO sandbox environment
3. **2-week pilot** to prove Mission Control coordinates HALO agents better

**What you get:**
- ✅ Full demo customized to your workflows
- ✅ Pilot integration (no upfront cost)
- ✅ Proof that orchestration unlocks HALO's full potential

**What happens if it works:**
- Option 1: White-label integration (revenue share)
- Option 2: Strategic partnership (equity/co-development)
- Option 3: You build it in-house (we helped you see the vision)

**Call-out box:**
> "No risk. Just proof."
