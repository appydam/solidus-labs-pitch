## 📁 What's Inside

### **1. DEMO_FLOW.md**
Complete demo script showing how Mission Control orchestrates HALO compliance agents.

**Highlights:**
- Wash trading investigation workflow (8 minutes, end-to-end)
- 3 "wow moments" for compliance VPs
- Talking points for Asaf (CEO) and engineering leadership
- Demo environment setup instructions

**Use case:** Prepare for live demo or screen recording

---

### **2. PITCH_DECK.md**
7-slide pitch deck structure (markdown → export to PDF via Canva/Figma)

**Slides:**
1. Problem: HALO agents don't coordinate
2. Solution: Mission Control = orchestration layer
3. Demo: Wash trading investigation workflow
4. Partnership Options: Agent Ops, Internal Ops, or Strategic Partnership
5. Proof: We use what we sell (4 AI agents, $40k ARR)
6. Traction: Built in 1 week, ready to pilot
7. Ask: 30-min call → 2-week pilot → partnership

**Use case:** Send to Solidus leadership or present on a call

---

### **3. OBJECTIONS.md**
Comprehensive objection handling guide.

**Covers 10+ objections:**
- "We're building in-house"
- "We already have dashboards"
- "This seems like overkill"
- "We need to evaluate vendors"
- "What if you shut down?"
- Pricing, legal, integration, and more

**Use case:** Prepare for sales conversations, anticipate pushback

## 🎯 Target Audience

**Primary Contact:**
- **Asaf Meir** — CEO, Solidus Labs
- Uses language: "agentic automation", "exponential efficiency"

**Secondary Contacts:**
- VP Product (focused on HALO roadmap)
- VP Engineering (focused on integration feasibility)
- Head of Compliance (focused on regulatory/audit value)

## 🚀 Pitch Strategy

### **Positioning:**
> "HALO detects. Mission Control orchestrates."

### **Key Value Props:**
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Coordinate HALO agents in real-time
2. **Auditable Human Oversight** — Compliance officers review with full audit trails
3. **End-to-End Visibility** — From alert to resolution, every step tracked

### **Three Partnership Options:**
1. **White-Label** — Embed Mission Control into HALO as a native feature
2. **Internal Ops** — Solidus uses Mission Control for their own agent workflows
3. **Strategic Partnership** — Co-develop the orchestration layer together

---

## 📊 Why Solidus?

**Opportunity identified by Scout (Research Agent):**
- Solidus processes **1 trillion+ events/day** with HALO
- HALO has **NO multi-agent orchestration layer** (confirmed via research)
- Asaf's language aligns with our value prop ("agentic automation")
- They're growing fast → orchestration becomes MORE critical at scale

**Strategic fit:**
- We built Mission Control for our own AI agents (4 agents, live in production)
- Solidus builds compliance infrastructure for crypto → we build orchestration infrastructure for agents
- Both solve coordination problems at scale
